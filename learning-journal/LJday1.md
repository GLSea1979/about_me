#Learning Journal

##Day 1

  I have learned some keyboard shortcuts and tricks in Atom. Atom is a file editor I have really never used. There are lots of slow moments right now. Other classmates questions that seem way off topic or really basic and I struggle to stay in tune. Also if the TA doesn't understand our setup i.e. windows, we are stuck googling it.

##Day 2 & Day 3

  Still having as many issues with the tools we are using as with the material we are learning. I am feeling good about my learning, I feel like there are a bunch of people who really have stuff figured out and are coming along well. I worry though that there seem to be a handful of people who already falling behind. I am happy with my progress but wish there was more opportunity for direct feedback and question answering. Sometimes it feels like I could do this at home with YouTube and a list of projects I should work on.
